### Important!
_**DBHandler** class may have been detached for security reasons. In that case, contact the Author(s) to obtain the file which will be provided only for the developers who are involved in the development process._  
_Database operations will **FAIL** unless you request and attach the above-mentioned file, in case the file is not already included._  
  
_You may experience a delay when the movies are loading, the reason being the location of the server the frontend has been deployed._  
  
_Genre Predictions/ Movie Recommendations ML Service may not work properly even though the front-end works fine since the back-end is hosted seperately as a standalone API. In case the API calls fail, you'll be notified via in-app notifications._
